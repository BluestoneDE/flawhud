## FlawHUD

It's a HUD alright...

####Installation
Extract the zipped file contents into `Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`

####Custom Crosshairs (KnucklesCrosses)
Custom crosshairs are disabled by default - to turn them on, go to `scripts\hudlayout.res` and under the `KnucklesCrosses` node change the values to the right of `visible` and `enabled` from 0 to 1.

To change the crosshair style, in the same node change the property of `labelText` to the corresponding crosshair letter in the KnucklesCrosses.png image file that can be found in the same 'scripts' folder.

####Transparent Viewmodels
While the necessary files and entry in hudslayout (disabled by default) are included, the config necessary to use Transparent Viewmodels will not be included. This is due to a number of people having graphical issues due to their configs conflicting, so for those of you needing them - you'll have to find a config or modify your existing one accordingly.

### Excluded Features
* Classic Main Menu Style (There won't be anymore support for it, so it'll be excluded)
* Miscellaneous Gamemodes (Arena, Passtime, Player/Robot Destruction etc.)
